  I am currently studying the final year of my bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Engineering at Sharif University of Technology, Iran.
  My research interests include **Deep Learning** in particular, and **Machine Learning** in general, with applications in **Computer Vision**, **Graph Learning**, and **Economics**. 
  I am intended to better understand these methods in a principled manner by investigating 
  their practical implications in real life. 
  Although the recently proposed techniques have demonstrated remarkable performance, 
  significant challenges in terms of Explaining their results remain unresolved. 
  My research goal is to channel such better **theoretical and functional** understandings of 
  these new methods towards better **practical solutions** for real life problems.
