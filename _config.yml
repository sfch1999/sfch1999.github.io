  I am currently studying the final year of my bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Engineering at Sharif University of Technology (SUT), Iran.
  In June 2019, I joined Data Science & Machine Learning Lab (DML) in SUT, to carry out research as a research assistant. Since then, I have been conducting research on Computer Vision with an emphasis on developing deep learning methods for medical applications. Moreover,
  In 2020, I received a prestigious research award which gave me the opportunity to work with Prof. Navab, one of the most prestigious professors in Biomedical & Medical Informatics at the Chair for Computer Aided Medical Procedures (CAMP), Technical University of Munich (TUM), Germany.
  My research interests include Computer Vision, Deep Learning in general, and Interpretable ML. I am also interested in interplay between ML and health.
  my intention is to better understand these methods in a principled manner by investigating 
  their practical implications in real life.
