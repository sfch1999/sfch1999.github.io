    In September 2021, I joined [Finhub](https://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/FacultyAndResearch/ResearchCentres/FinHub) as a Machine Learning Researcher under the supervision of **[Prof. John Hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Hull_(economist))**.
    My major involvement was in a project studying the use of **Deep Reinforcement Learning** on **Hedging** strategies. At first, I had to design several portfolio environments that could manage different options.
    After that, I conducted a literature review on Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms in order to find out which one can be used for our purpose. I found out that **Distributional DRL** can be a great help as
    we can design and support different financial/statistical **objective functions**. I tried two different methods and optimized one of them for the project. At last, by fine-tuning the proposed model, we could
    outperform other existing methods which are used on a daily basis by companies. Three objective functions were designed for different purposes that can be used based on the trader's hedging preference. During
    this project, I had the honor to work with Prof. Hull, who is considered to be the godfather of Derivatives. This led me to gain a lot of financial and DRL experience while generating great results. The paper is
    submitted to a conference, and we are preparing a Jurnal version as well.

    In June 2020, I joined Computer Aided Medical Procedures ([CAMP](http://campar.in.tum.de)) as an intern
    under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Nassir Navab](http://campar.in.tum.de/Main/NassirNavab) at Technical University of Munich (TUM).
    At first, I started to study the recently emerging topic of **Geometric Deep Learning**. Since I was fascinated by Graph Neural Networks,
    I managed to conduct a literature review in a short period of time. In the meantime, we studied the state-of-the-art methods in **interpretability**. Furthermore,
    in order to investigate the GNN's functionality, I implemented several pre-existed methods and tried to understand how exactly they produce
    results when health-related datasets are used. After a while, I took the initiative and proposed a new model capable of **interpreting** in an end-to-end training fashion.
    This paper is submitted to **MICCAI 2021**.

    In 2019, I joined the **Medical Image Analysis** group in Data Science & Machine Learning Lab (DML) as a **research assistant** under the supervision of
    [Prof. Rabiee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=rKDtrNgAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and
    [Prof. Rohban](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=pRyJ6FkAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).
    My first major involvement with the team was on a research project aiming to classify **X-Ray** images into two groups of Normal and Abnormal. Regardless of the
    undeniable value of this research, my most noteworthy research experience in the Medical Image Analysis group
    has been a project on **Dementia Disease**. In this project, I proposed a novel segmentation method that helped us to outperform the state-of-the-art
    models.  The manuscript is submitted to **MICCAI 2021**.

    During the summer of 2019, I worked for a start-up called [Yektanet](https://www.en.yektanet.com/), an online advertisement platform in my country.
    This platform is basically publishing advertisements on well-known publishers to achieve clicks and views.
    I was employed as a data science intern and developed algorithms to help advertisers **target new customers who are likely to be interested in their business**
    using existing and innovative machine learning methods.

    In June 2018, I joined a start-up called [Pido](https://pidonet.com/en/home/), One of the largest Fuel Delivery companies in the Middle East.
    I mainly worked on a project which was a collaboration between Pido and [PEC](https://en.pec.ir), a Payment Service Provider in Iran. In this
    project, we developed a method to scan Persian and English debit cards and extract the necessary information. An API based on our method is now
    deployed in both companies' applications. In this project, I proposed a novel method that is capable of removing the background of digits
    for better Optical Character Recognition performance.

      [DataDays](http://datadays.sharif.edu/) was the **First National Data Scientific Competition** held
      by the Sharif University of Technology.
      Its main goal was to broaden the appeal for working on problems related to data.
      Moreover, it is a large-scale attempt to assess the level of knowledge in this field in Iran.

      As a volunteer, I joined the Assessment Staff and led a group of four people. We proposed questions which could be solved by Machine Learning and Deep Learning methods.
      In addition, we developed some [Perisan Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/datadays-content/datadays-content.github.io) as tutorials mostly related
      to Data Analysis and Machine Learning. We made it accessible to all the teams in order to encourage them to raise their skill and knowledge in these fields.

      The whole competition was centred around working on a dataset collected by [Cafebazaar](https://cafebazaar.ir/) from [Divar](http://divar.ir).
      This dataset mainly comprises online advertisements published by people in different categories.
