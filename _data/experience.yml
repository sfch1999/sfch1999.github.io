    In June 2020, I joined Computer Aided Medical Procedures ([CAMP](http://campar.in.tum.de)), as an intern 
    under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Nassir Navab](http://campar.in.tum.de/Main/NassirNavab), at Technical University of Munich (TUM). 
    At first, I started to study the recently emerging topic of **Geometric Deep Learning**. Since I was fascinated by Graph Neural Networks, 
    I managed to master it in a short period of time. In the meantime, we studied the state-of-the-art methods in **interpretability**. Furthermore, 
    in order to investigate the GNN's functionality, I implemented several pre-existed methods and tried to understand how exactly they are producing 
    results when health-related datasets are used. After a while, I took the initiative and proposed a new model capable of **explaining GNNs**. 
    Subsequently, we started to experiment my proposal on medical datasets which allowed us to evaluate the explanations. Right now, we are preparing 
    a manuscript to publish the results on **MICCAI2021**.

    In 2019, I joined **Medical Image Analysis** group in Data science & Machine learning Lab (DML) as a **research assistant** under the supervision of 
    [Prof. Rabiee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=rKDtrNgAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and 
    [Dr. Rohban](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=pRyJ6FkAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).
    My first major involvement with the team was on a research project aiming to classify **X-Ray** radiographs into two groups of Normal and Abnormal. Regardless of the 
    undeniable value of this research, my most noteworthy research experience in Medical Image Analysis group 
    has been a project on **Dimentia Desease**. In this project, I proposed a novel segmentation method which helped us to outperform the state-of-the-art 
    models.  Right now, we are preparing a manuscript to publish the results on [Medical Image Analysis - Elsevier](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/medical-image-analysis).

  job_title: Scientific Staff
  dates: December 2018 - March 2019

    [DataDays](http://datadays.sharif.edu/) was the **First National Data Scientific Competition** held 
    by Sharif University of Technology.
    Its main goal was to broaden appeal for working on problems related to data. 
    Moreover, it is a large-scale attempt to assess the level of knowledge in this field in Iran.
    
    As a volunteer, I joined the Scientific Staff and help them to propose questions which could be solved by Machine Learning and Deep Learning methods.
    In addition, we developed some [Perisan Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/datadays-content/datadays-content.github.io) as tutorials mostly related 
    to Data Analysis and Machine Learning. We made it accessible to all the teams in order to encourage them to raise their skill and knowledge in these fields. 
    
    The whole competition was centered around working on a dataset collected by [Cafebazaar](https://cafebazaar.ir/) from [Divar](http://divar.ir).
    This dataset mainly comprises online advertisements published by people in different categories.

    During summer of 2017, I worked for a start-up called [Yektanet](https://www.yektanet.com/), an online advertisement platform in my country. 
    This platform is basically publishing advertisements on well-known publishers for achieving clicks and views. 
    I was employed as data scientist and developed algorithms **determining the subject of web pages using their textual data**. 
    They are now deployed for displaying relevant items of advertisement on each webpage.
