    ## **Explainable Latent-Graph Learning for Disease Prediction**
    
    ---
    
    Current **Graph Convolutional Networks** mainly depend on the given geometric structure where the graph adjacency matrix represents pair-wise node similarities. Until now, 
    the similarity metrics have been defined **manually**, which is not feasible nor accurate for many datasets. Furthermore, The main shortcoming 
    of GCNs is the lack of information about how they generate a specific output.
    To this end, we proposed a novel, end-to-end trainable **graph learning** architecture for dynamic and localized graph pruning. Furthermore, 
    this method generates an **explanation** for given features which can help us understand what is going on under the hood.

    ## **Classification of the Visual Biomarkers of Dementia Disease Based on Fazekas Scale**
    
    ---
    
    Some of the evaluations of people with **Dementia** are based on imaging, which is used to understand the severity of the disease and analyze changes over time.
    Among the Dementia biomarkers, ”Periventricular White Matter Changes(PVWM)” has been of the most importance.
    Towards this, we introduce a model which can classify patients based on PVWM into four groups. 
    In order to achieve this, we take advantage of **Multiple Instance Learning** and **Self-Supervised Learning**. However, one of 
    the main novelties of our model is the **preprocessing** stage which we've invented. This technique allows us to segment the White Matter Lesions
    in order to achieve higher accuracy. 
    The other advantage of our proposed method is that our model is based on **thick slice MRI**, which is the main setting used to attain MRI scans in Imaging Centers.
