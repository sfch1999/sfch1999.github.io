    ## **Explainable Latent-Graph Learning for Disease Prediction**
    
    ---
    
    Current **Graph Convolutional Networks** mainly depend on the given geometric structure where the graph adjacency matrix represents pair-wise node similarities. Until now, 
    the similarity metrics have been defined **manually**, which is not feasible nor accurate for many datasets. Furthermore, The main shortcoming 
    of GCNs is the lack of information about how they generate a specific output.
    To this end, we proposed a novel, end-to-end trainable **graph learning** architecture for dynamic and localized graph pruning. Furthermore, 
    this method generates an **explanation** for given features which can help us understand what is going on under the hood.

    ## **Classification of the Visual Biomarkers of Dementia Disease Based on Fazekas Scale**
    
    ---
    
    Often a varied order of importance for the multi-modal heterogeneous data is considered for personalized disease diagnosis decisions.
    Towards this, we introduce a model which not only improves the disease prediction but also focuses on 
    learning **patient-specific** order of importance for multi-modal data elements. 
    In order to achieve this, we take advantage of **LSTM-based attention mechanism** and **graph convolutional networks (GCNs)**
    to design our model. GCNs learn multi-modal but class-specific features from the entire population of patients, 
    whereas the attention mechanism optimally fuses these multi-modal features into a final decision, separately for each patient.

    ## **InceptionGCN: Receptive Field Aware Graph Convolutional Network for Disease Prediction**
    
    ---
    
    In this paper, we introduce a new spectral domain architecture for deep learning on graphs for disease prediction. 
    The novelty lies in defining geometric **Inception Modules** which are capable of capturing intra and inter-graph structural heterogeneity during convolutions. 
    We design filters with different kernel sizes to build our architecture.

    ## **Self-Attention Equipped Graph Convolutions For Disease Prediction**
    
    ---
    
    Multi-modal data comprising imaging (MRI, fMRI, etc.) and non-imaging (demographics, etc.) data can be collected together and used for disease prediction. 
    A model capable of leveraging the individuality of each multi-modal data is required for better disease prediction. 
    We propose a graph convolution based deep model which takes into account the distinctiveness of each element of the multi-modal data. 
    We incorporate a novel **Self-Attention Layer**, which weights every element of the demographic data 
    by exploring its relation to the underlying disease.
