    ## **Cell type identification in single-cell RNA sequencing based on gene interaction networks**
    
    ---
    
    Current single-cell classification methods take genes as independent features to assign cell types disregarding
    their interactome which has been shown to be of great importance in cellular processes. Here, we introduce 
    **single-cell Graph Convolutional Network (scGCN)** which takes gene-gene interactions into account by constructing
    a co-expression network of a subset of genes and uses a graph deep learning approach to classify single-cells.
