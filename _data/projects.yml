    ## **Explainable Latent-Graph Learning for Disease Prediction**
    
    ---
    
    Current **Graph Convolutional Networks** mainly depend on the given geometric structure where the graph adjacency matrix represents pair-wise node similarities. Until now, 
    the similarity metrics have been defined **manually**, which is not feasible nor accurate for many datasets. Furthermore, The main shortcoming 
    of GCNs is the lack of information about how they generate a specific output.
    To this end, we proposed a novel, end-to-end trainable **graph learning** architecture for dynamic and localized graph pruning. Furthermore, 
    this method generates an **explanation** for given features which can help us understand what is going on under the hood.

    ## **Classification of the Visual Biomarkers of Dementia Disease Based on Fazekas Scale**
    
    ---
    
    Some of the evaluations of people with dementia are based on imaging, which is used to understand the severity of the disease and analyze changes over time.
    Among the Dementia biomarkers, ”Periventricular White Matter Changes(PVWM)” has been of the most importance.
    Towards this, we introduce a model which can classify patients based on PVWM scale into four groups. 
    In order to achieve this, we take advantage of **Multiple Instance Learning** and **Self-Supervised Learning**. However, one of 
    the main novelties of our model is the preproccessing stage which we've invented. This technique allows us to segment White Matter Lisions 
    in order to achieve higher accuracy. 
    The other advantage of our proposed model is that we used thick slice MRI dataset which is the main setting used to attain MRI scans in Imaging Centers.

    ## **InceptionGCN: Receptive Field Aware Graph Convolutional Network for Disease Prediction**
    
    ---
    
    In this paper, we introduce a new spectral domain architecture for deep learning on graphs for disease prediction. 
    The novelty lies in defining geometric **Inception Modules** which are capable of capturing intra and inter-graph structural heterogeneity during convolutions. 
    We design filters with different kernel sizes to build our architecture.

    ## **Self-Attention Equipped Graph Convolutions For Disease Prediction**
    
    ---
    
    Multi-modal data comprising imaging (MRI, fMRI, etc.) and non-imaging (demographics, etc.) data can be collected together and used for disease prediction. 
    A model capable of leveraging the individuality of each multi-modal data is required for better disease prediction. 
    We propose a graph convolution based deep model which takes into account the distinctiveness of each element of the multi-modal data. 
    We incorporate a novel **Self-Attention Layer**, which weights every element of the demographic data 
    by exploring its relation to the underlying disease.
